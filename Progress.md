# Progress

## Introduction

I came across [P1xt's SpeedStudy](https://github.com/P1xt/speedstudy) idea a few days after starting the [Computer Science and Web Development](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/cs-wd.md) guide—just as I was wondering how long it will all take (well, the goal is a bit of a moving target at the time of writing). It seems like the perfect way to keep myself accountable and motivated, as well as to serve as an indication of what can and cannot be achieved to others. This document is derived from the [Computer Science and Web Development template](https://github.com/P1xt/speedstudy/blob/master/progress-2018/template/template-wd-cs.md) in the SpeedStudy repository.

In addition to keep track of my progress, the [study notes](https://github.com/honmanyau/study-notes) found in the other files and directories in this repository are also there to keep myself accountable and are intended to be review material for myself (or perhaps others). They are not organised by the material they are collected/interpreted from. Due references to resources are made wherever possible.

In case the speed at which I go through materials seems unusually fast to anyone who comes across this repository—when I just started I am already quite comfortable working with JavaScript, HTML and CSS and have done some computer science basics. Also, I was unemployed when this first started on 2018.06.04 and am dedicating approximately 8–12 hours a day, excluding breaks, on studying. I will try my best to document "interruptions" so that the picture is realistic for anyone who happens to come across this.

I envisage that there will also be times when I seem to be going through material too slowly (if there are no documented interruptions). In those cases it is most likely because for each task/type of material I am going through, I would usually check the references suggested in it, too. An good example is understanding how the (call) stack, queue, heap, event loop, and the "microqueue" used by the JavaScript `Promise`s fit together and what each individual parts do—which took a substantial amount of time.

## Goals

### 2018

It appears that I focused too much on the coding part in the last year or so of self-teaching coding but don't know enough computer science fundamentals. The goal is to become job-ready enough to re-apply for a job at a company that I really want to work at or, if that opportunity is no longer available or a similar opportunity comes up, knowledgable enough to be offered those opportunities.
