## Notes

### Module 1

#### Introductory reading and videos (1 hour)

- Goal: learning the core ideas around how all programming languages built.
- Understand ideas we use when we program and how they are expressed in languages.
- Yay, it's going to be lots of functional programming!

#### Part A Software Installation and Use: SML and Emacs (1 hour of failure on macOS and 30 minutes on Windows)

- Installing SML/NJ was a bit painful on macOS, and in the end I still ended up with a segmentation fault when I ran `1 + 1;`. In favour of actually doing something actually useful I decided to just switch to my Windows machine.


#### Practice Programming Assignment: Homework 0 (30 minutes)

- [Solution (100/100)](./homework-0/homework-0-solution.sml)
- Peer-reviewed 3 solutions. ‚òÄÔ∏èüéâ
